Step by step to Coding:
Step 1. Create Interfaces with it's a class library , which contains three classes:
 ICreditUnionFactory as an Abstract class , it have two method: CreateLoanAcct and CreatSavingsAcct
-Interfaces for Products as Interface classes:
+ Product A: ILoanAccount
+ Product B: ISavingsAccount

Step 2. Build Concrete Factory and Products :
a. For Citi Credit Union: The classes implements for Interfaces and abstracts, which have defined at the step 1
-CitiLoanAccount implement ILoanAccount
-LoanSavingsAccount implement ISavingsAccount
-CitiCreditUnionFactory inherit ICreditUnionFactory, and override availble defined methods 
b. For Nation Credit Union: The classes implements for Interfaces and abstracts, which have defined at the step 1
-NationLoanAccount implement ILoanAccount
-NationSavingsAccount implement ISavingsAccount
-NationCreditUnionFactory inherit ICreditUnionFactory, and override availble defined methods 

Step 3: Write abstract factory provider and client code
